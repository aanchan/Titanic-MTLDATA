Titanic-MTLDATA
===============

The goal of this IPython Notebook is to introduce you to some tools in Python for data-processing and machine learning. It is my no means exhaustive in any of the aspects of either Python, Machine Learning, Data-processing in Python or any of their permutations. The Machine Learning classifier used in this Notebook is one of the simplest classifiers called Logistic Regression models. The data-set on which the examples are run are taken from the Kaggle Titanic Challenge. This example was specifically chosen since there are many tutorials, IPython Notebooks, articles blogs and resources online on the Titanic Challenge that would help a novice get started.
