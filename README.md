Titanic-MTLDATA
===============

The goal of this IPython Notebook is to introduce you to some tools in Python for data-processing and machine learning. It is my no means exhaustive in any of the aspects of either Python, Machine Learning, Data-processing in Python or any of their permutations. The Machine Learning classifier used in this Notebook is one of the simplest classifiers called Logistic Regression models. The data-set on which the examples are run are taken from the Kaggle Titanic Challenge. This example was specifically chosen since there are many tutorials, IPython Notebooks, articles blogs and resources online on the Titanic Challenge that would help a novice get started. 

To view this notebook online click on this [this link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/aanchan/Titanic-MTLDATA/blob/master/akTitanicSKLearn.ipynb). This IPython notebook above assumes that you already have some facility in working with Python.

Installing tools required for this Notebook to run on your system.
----
	1. Python
	2. IPython (Optional since you could run the Python commands from the IPython 
	   	   notebook on your native Python interpreter)
	3. Numpy
	4. Scipy
	5. Pandas
	6. Scikit-Learn

Installation methods vary depending on the Operating System. [Here](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/setting-up-scientific-python.html) is a great link on completing a setup in Python for scientific purposes. 

Below are pointers to some resources that might help you get started off. 


The Kaggle Titanic Challenge
----
Read about it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)

Introduction to Logistic Regression
----
[A Simple Explanation from Duke Medicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Po-xZJflPM)
[Logistic Regression for Classification](http://youtu.be/nMcxOiVj7oE)

Introduction to Python
----
[Course from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython). This does not require you to download and install Python. They have a version for the course that runs off the browser interactively.
[The best intro I think, from Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html)

Introduction to the Numpy module in Python
----
[The Tentative Numpy Tutorial](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial) is a good place to start.

Introduction to Scikit-Learn(referred to in this document also as SKLearn)
----
Here is a great introduction on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. Its a tutorial from [PyCon 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjAB45qsx_c).

Introduction to Pandas
---
The [Python Pandas Cookbook Lecture Series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyBBc46Y6aAz54aOUgKXXyTcEmpMisAq3) on Youtube by Alfred Essa is a good place to start. Specifically to load our Titanic data set Alfred Essa talks about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhkchS9gSYk#t=545) in Lesson 1.2.
